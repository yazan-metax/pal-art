# IntroductionüöÄ:

## Project Name:pal-art

## Description:

This project, developed using the C programming language and the MiniLibX library, is a celebration of the rich cultural heritage of Palestinian embroidery. Inspired by the remarkable work of [`Tirazain`](https://tirazain.com/) in digitizing and preserving traditional Palestinian embroidery patterns, known as Tatreez, this program brings these intricate designs to life in the digital world.

## Background‚Ü©Ô∏è:

Palestinian embroidery, with its detailed patterns and vibrant history, has been a significant medium of expression and identity for centuries. Each pattern tells a unique story, rich with cultural significance and historical context. The digitization efforts by [`Tirazain`](https://tirazain.com/) not only help in preserving these patterns but also make them accessible to a global audience, thus promoting a deeper appreciation of Palestinian culture.
