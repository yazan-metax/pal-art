<h1 align="center">Palestinian embroidery üçâ</h1>

# IntroductionüöÄ:

## Project Name:pal-art

## Description:

This project, developed using the C programming language and the MiniLibX library, is a celebration of the rich cultural heritage of Palestinian embroidery. Inspired by the remarkable work of [`Tirazain`](https://tirazain.com/) in digitizing and preserving traditional Palestinian embroidery patterns, known as Tatreez, this program brings these intricate designs to life in the digital world.

## Background‚Ü©Ô∏è:

Palestinian embroidery, with its detailed patterns and vibrant history, has been a significant medium of expression and identity for centuries. Each pattern tells a unique story, rich with cultural significance and historical context. The digitization efforts by [`Tirazain`](https://tirazain.com/) not only help in preserving these patterns but also make them accessible to a global audience, thus promoting a deeper appreciation of Palestinian culture.

## Project Goalsüåç:

### With this project, I aim to:

- **Demonstrate the Beauty of Palestinian Embroidery:** The program recreates these designs programmatically, highlighting the intricacy and artistry of Palestinian embroidery patterns.

- **Bridge Tradition with Modern Technology:** This project illustrates the synergy between traditional art and contemporary technology.

- **Educate and Inspire:** I hope to educate viewers about Palestinian culture through these digital representations and inspire them to explore the traditions behind these patterns.

- **Contribute to Cultural Preservation:** This work aligns with the broader goal of preserving cultural heritage and supports initiatives like Tirazain's in keeping traditional arts alive in our modern world.
- **Expand and Enhance:** Currently, the program visualizes one of the designs from Tirazain. Moving forward, I plan to add more features and create as many designs as possible, continuously evolving the project.

## Technology Stack‚öôÔ∏è:

- **Programming Language:** C
- **Graphics Library:** MiniLibX,standart c libraries
- **Files:** .h,.c,Makefile
