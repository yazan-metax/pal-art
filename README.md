# Introduction

## Project Name:pal-art

## Description:

This project, developed using the C programming language and the MiniLibX library, is a celebration of the rich cultural heritage of Palestinian embroidery. Inspired by the remarkable work of [`Tirazain`](https://tirazain.com/) in digitizing and preserving traditional Palestinian embroidery patterns, known as Tatreez, this program brings these intricate designs to life in the digital world.
